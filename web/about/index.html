      <p>
        Podium is the social network of everything:
        We have multiple networking styles for you to use.
        Additionally, we will supply integrations with other services, such as
        <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, which we actually use for our
        own promotion with the account
        <a href="http://twitter.com/podium_snw">@podium_snw</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
