      <h1>Podium Governance</h1>
      <p>
        Podium is not a company.
        It is simply a collection of people united in support of the project.
        If you use or support podium, we will consider you part of podium.
      </p>
      <h2>Power</h2>
      <p>
        Some podium members have more power than others in what happens
        regarding code, content, public image, and other parts of podium.
        Our founder, htmlguy, has the most power over most of podium, since
        he is the one with the power over our web servers, twitter account,
        domain name, and GitHub organization.
        It is unavoidable that he personally permits or denies every change
        made to our code base before pushing these changes to the web server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does htmlguy have all this power?
        Because of trust.
        He created the group and knows that he has no malicious intentions for
        podium.
        But he cannot hand over power to any other individuals without having to
        directly oversee what they do.
        Why? Because he can't trust them.
        He wishes he could, but he can't.
        Therefore, he will attempt, as podium lives on, to allow more and more
        power to other trustable members, but he will likely never be able to
        abandon his position at the head of all changes.
